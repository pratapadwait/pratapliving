About Us: The Pratap Living Story
The Vision
At Pratap Living, we believe that hospitality is more than just a place to stay; it is an experience rooted in comfort, privacy, and the unique warmth of Lucknow. In a world of generic hotel rooms, we provide curated, premium spaces that feel like home but offer the luxury of a boutique retreat. From the quiet expanse of Sushant Golf City to the urban pulse of Omaxe Hazratganj, our mission is to host your most important moments with excellence.

A Note from Our Founder
"Pratap Living was born out of a simple passion: to redefine the way people experience my home city. Whether it is our signature 6BHK+ Luxury Villa in Sushant Golf City or our Executive Penthouse in Omaxe Hazratganj, every detail has been personally curated by me.

When you book a stay with us, you aren’t just getting a key; you are getting a commitment to quality and the true 'Nawabi' spirit of Lucknow. Whether you are here for a family reunion, a wedding, or a corporate milestone, I am honored to welcome you."

— Pratap Adwait Singh, Founder, Pratap Living
